# ENSE271 Team Project Activity 3_Mangos

**To-do**

1. **High-fidelity prototype (HFP)** exploration (teams should produce one fully-interactive high-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD. The HFP should explore responsive design (mobile and desktop look and feel) as well as imagery, colour, type, and fully interactive "points & clicks."

2. Ensure you link design ideas back to a minimum of three topics discussed in class relating to people-centred design (affordances, gestalt, constraints, etc.). **Document** these in a 1-page PDF (with screenshots/images as necessary)

3. **Updated user story map**, if required (regardless, ensure to do a PDF export from StoriesOnBoard) with envisioned MVPs as a snapshot of changes/no changes)
Summarized customer notes from customer check-ins (2-page maximum)

4. **Self/peer review files** (uploaded to URCourses only)

5. **All files** uploaded to GitHub
