# ENSE271 Team Project Activity 3_Mangos

**To-do**

1. **High-fidelity prototype (HFP)** exploration (teams should produce one fully-interactive high-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD. The HFP should explore responsive design (mobile and desktop look and feel) as well as imagery, colour, type, and fully interactive "points & clicks."

✅ [Hi-Fi Prototype Desktop Ver.](https://github.com/havr67/mangosense271/blob/activity_3/ENSE271%20Mangos%20Hi-Fi%20web%20Ver..xd)

✅ [Hi-Fi Prototype Mobile Ver.](https://github.com/havr67/mangosense271/blob/activity_3/ENSE271%20Mangos%20Hi-Fi%20mobile%20Ver..xd)

2. Ensure you link design ideas back to a minimum of three topics discussed in class relating to people-centred design (affordances, gestalt, constraints, etc.). **Document** these in a 1-page PDF (with screenshots/images as necessary)
