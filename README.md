# ENSE271 Team Project Activity 2_Mangos

**To-do**

1. Proposed navigations/**site maps**, i.e. how your team envisions supporting "digital wayfinding" (teams should produce at least one navigation/site map/team member, e.g. a team of 3 should have at least 3 different site maps proposals to be tested/explored.

2. **Low-fidelity prototype** explorations (teams should produce at least one low-fidelity interface/team member, e.g. a team of 3 should have at least 3 different low-fidelity prototypes to be tested/explored.
Ensure low-fidelity prototypes link to design ideas discussed in class; a minimum of three topics discussed in class relating to people-centred design (affordances, gestalt, constraints, etc.). Document these in a 1-page PDF

3. **Updated user story map**, if required (regardless, ensure to do a PDF export from StoriesOnBoard) with envisioned MVPs as a snapshot of changes/no changes)

4. **Summarized customer notes** from customer check-ins (2-page maximum)

5. **Self/peer review files** (uploaded to URCourses only)

- help the users experience and beneficial for both sides
