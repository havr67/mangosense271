# ENSE271 Team Project Activity 4_Mangos

**To-do**
1. **Summarized customer notes** from customer check-ins (2-page maximum) ✅ 

- [Last Customer Notes](https://github.com/havr67/mangosense271/blob/activity_4/ENSE271%20Group%20Project-check%20in%20Apr%204.pdf) 

2. **API and other configuration files**

We explored and tested our API chatbot in different repo so that the files might be hard to find but we make sure to put direct links to those files.

- [Chatbot Repo](https://github.com/havr67/chat_bot)
- [API Main file](https://github.com/havr67/mangosense271/blob/test_branch/app/controllers/nikita.js)
- [Server for API](https://github.com/havr67/mangosense271/blob/test_branch/)
To start the server, use npm start (Visual Studio)

  **Demo:**
  ---
  **You need to start the server using "npm start" to see our API chatbot demonstration!!**
  
  We documented inside the programming/code so that the users can see how each functions work and how to call API.
