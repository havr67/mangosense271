**Project Assumption:**

We are going to use NodeJS, python and WordPress, for the realization of the project. NodeJS for server side and frontend. Python for bot algorithms.


**Project Constraints:**

While making a chatbot for the FOOD BANK, the one main constraint is a lack of experience and knowledge. We will need to have a good quality outcome in the limited time we have to solve the majority of problems.
